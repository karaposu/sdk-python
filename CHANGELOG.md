# Bright Data Python SDK Changelog

## Version 2.6.0 - Structured errors

- **Every non-2xx is now a typed exception.** `AsyncEngine` previously converted only 401/403 and handed every other failure back as a normal response, leaving each subsystem to improvise. Classification now happens once, at the single point every request passes through: `429` → the new **`RateLimitError`** (with `retry_after` parsed from the header), other 4xx/5xx → `APIError`.
- **Exceptions carry data, not just prose.** `BrightDataError` gained `status_code`, `url`, `method`, `retry_after`, `retryable` and `raw` (the response body, bounded to 4 KB). Callers can branch on the failure instead of parsing its message.
- **Fixed**: a rate-limited dataset request surfaced as an aiohttp *content-type* error, because the 429 body is a bare string and the response was parsed as JSON before its status was checked. It now raises `RateLimitError`.
- **Fixed**: a token expiring mid-poll was reported as `"Job failed with status: error"` — blaming the user's scrape for an authentication problem. `DatasetAPIClient.get_status` no longer collapses every non-200 into the status string `"error"`.
- **Results carry the failure too.** `ScrapeResult` / `CrawlResult` gained `cause`, the originating exception, populated wherever one is converted into a result. `error` remains the human-readable message:
  ```python
  result = await client.scrape.x.posts(url)
  if not result.success and isinstance(result.cause, RateLimitError):
      await asyncio.sleep(result.cause.retry_after or 60)
  ```
- **Retry is now opt-in.** `retry_with_backoff` no longer retries by exception type. An error with no status code is raised locally — sometimes *after* the server accepted the work — so repeating it could create a duplicate billed job; those are never retried. Explicit 5xx still is. **429 never is**, because those responses consume quota and retrying extends the lockout.
- `DatasetError` now subclasses `BrightDataError` (still catchable as before). `RateLimitError` and `DataNotReadyError` are exported from `brightdata` top level.
- **Note on messages**: error messages are shorter and more uniform, with detail moved to attributes. Code matching on message *text* may need updating; use `status_code` instead.
- **Known limit**: this is status-based, so it cannot see HTTP 200 responses carrying an error in the body (SERP's inner envelope, Web Unlocker error content). Those remain string-shaped.

## Version 2.4.0 - Sync parity, colorless job verbs, dataset error reporting

- **Sync client parity**: `SyncBrightDataClient` now mirrors the async surface. Added `client.datasets` (fixes the `SyncBrightDataClient` `datasets` `AttributeError`), the 5 missing scrapers (`scrape.tiktok` / `youtube` / `reddit` / `perplexity` / `digikey`), the 2 missing search verticals (`search.tiktok` / `youtube`), Pinterest trigger/status/fetch, and Instagram-search `profiles` / `reels_all`.
- **Service-level job verbs (colorless pattern)**: every scraper now exposes generic `status` / `wait` / `fetch` / `to_result(snapshot_id)` (on `BaseWebScraper`), and `DiscoverService` gained `status` / `wait` / `fetch` / `to_result(task_id)` — so a triggered job can be driven by its id alone, like the crawler. Purely additive; the existing `job.fetch()` etc. are unchanged.
- **Discover sync manual path (new)**: `SyncBrightDataClient` adds `discover_status` / `discover_wait` / `discover_fetch` / `discover_to_result(task_id)`, and a colorless `DiscoverSnapshot` handle.
- **Contract change**: sync `discover_trigger()` now returns a `DiscoverSnapshot` (a typed, drivable handle) instead of the async-only `DiscoverJob` (which could not be used from sync). Migration: poll via `client.discover_status(snap.task_id)` / `client.discover_fetch(snap.task_id)`.
- **Fixed**: failed dataset snapshots now expose the API failure reason — and, when no recognized reason key is present, the raw snapshot status response as a fallback — plus the `snapshot_id`, instead of the unhelpful `DatasetError: Snapshot failed: None`. `SnapshotStatus` now retains the full API response (`.raw`) and matches more reason keys (`error` / `error_message` / `message` / `failure_reason`). The synchronous path inherits the fix.

## Version 2.3.0 - Browser API, Scraper Studio, 175 Datasets

- **Browser API**: Connect to cloud Chrome via CDP WebSocket. SDK builds the `wss://` URL, you connect with Playwright/Puppeteer (`client.browser.get_connect_url()`)
- **Scraper Studio**: Trigger and fetch results from custom scrapers built in Bright Data's IDE (`client.scraper_studio.run()`)
- **75 more datasets**: Agoda, AutoZone, BBC, Best Buy, Bluesky, Booking, Costco, eBay, Etsy, GitHub, Google News/Play/Shopping, Home Depot, Kroger, Lowe's, Macy's, Microcenter, Ozon, Quora, Realtor, Reddit, Snapchat, TikTok Shop, Tokopedia, Vimeo, Wayfair, Wikipedia, Wildberries, X/Twitter, Yahoo Finance, Zoopla, and more — **175 total**
- **Codebase cleanup**: Removed dead code and legacy abstractions — collapsed `datasets/client.py` from 1635 to 285 lines, fixed `ScrapeJob.to_result()` crash bug, cleaned up unused protocols, redundant config layers, and stale API modules
- **Test suite rewrite**: Rebuilt test suite from scratch with 365 unit tests, shared fixtures via `conftest.py`, behavioral coverage focus — key modules now at 87–98% coverage (client, scrapers, SERP, sync client, job lifecycle)

## Version 2.1.1 - Instagram Scrapers & Version Centralization

### ✨ New Features

#### Complete Instagram Scraper Implementation

Full Instagram scraping support with URL-based extraction and discovery endpoints:

**URL-based Scraping (`client.scrape.instagram`)**
- `profiles(url)` - Extract profile data from Instagram profile URL
- `posts(url)` - Extract post data from Instagram post URL
- `comments(url)` - Extract comments from Instagram post URL
- `reels(url)` - Extract reel data from Instagram reel URL

**Discovery/Search (`client.search.instagram`)**
- `profiles(user_name)` - Discover profile by exact username lookup
- `posts(url, num_of_posts, start_date, end_date, post_type)` - Discover posts from profile
- `reels(url, num_of_posts, start_date, end_date)` - Discover reels from profile
- `reels_all(url, num_of_posts, start_date, end_date)` - Discover all reels from profile

```python
async with BrightDataClient() as client:
    # URL-based scraping
    post = await client.scrape.instagram.posts("https://instagram.com/p/ABC123/")
    reel = await client.scrape.instagram.reels("https://instagram.com/reel/XYZ789/")

    # Discovery by username
    profile = await client.search.instagram.profiles(user_name="nasa")

    # Discover posts from profile with filters
    posts = await client.search.instagram.posts(
        url="https://instagram.com/nasa",
        num_of_posts=10,
        start_date="2024-01-01",
        end_date="2024-12-31"
    )
```

### 🔧 Internal Improvements

#### Version Centralization

Version is now managed from a single source (`pyproject.toml`). All other files read it dynamically via `importlib.metadata`.

**Before (5 files to update):**
- `pyproject.toml`
- `src/brightdata/__init__.py`
- `src/brightdata/_version.py`
- `src/brightdata/core/engine.py`
- `src/brightdata/cli/main.py`

**After (1 file to update):**
- `pyproject.toml` ← Single source of truth

**Changes:**
- `__init__.py` now uses `importlib.metadata.version("brightdata-sdk")`
- `_version.py` deleted (no longer needed)
- `engine.py` imports `__version__` for User-Agent header
- `cli/main.py` imports `__version__` for `--version` flag

---

## Version 2.1.0 - Async Mode, API Simplification & Bug Fixes

### ✨ New Features

#### SERP Async Mode

Added non-blocking async mode for SERP API using Bright Data's unblocker endpoints:

```python
from brightdata import BrightDataClient

async with BrightDataClient() as client:
    # Non-blocking - polls for results
    result = await client.search.google(
        query="python programming",
        mode="async",        # Enable async mode
        poll_interval=2,     # Check every 2 seconds
        poll_timeout=30      # Give up after 30 seconds
    )
```

**Supported Engines:** Google, Bing, Yandex

**Performance:** SERP async mode typically completes in ~3 seconds.

#### Web Unlocker Async Mode

Added non-blocking async mode for Web Unlocker API:

```python
async with BrightDataClient() as client:
    result = await client.scrape_url(
        url="https://example.com",
        mode="async",
        poll_interval=5,     # Check every 5 seconds
        poll_timeout=180     # Web Unlocker async takes ~2 minutes
    )

    # Batch scraping multiple URLs
    urls = ["https://example.com", "https://example.org"]
    results = await client.scrape_url(url=urls, mode="async", poll_timeout=180)
```

**Performance Warning:** Web Unlocker async mode takes ~2 minutes to complete. For faster single-URL scraping, use the default sync mode.

**How async mode works:**
1. Triggers request to `/unblocker/req` (returns immediately)
2. Polls `/unblocker/get_result` until ready or timeout
3. Returns same data structure as sync mode

**Key Benefits:**
- ✅ Non-blocking requests - continue work while scraping
- ✅ Batch optimization - trigger multiple URLs, collect later
- ✅ Same data structure as sync mode
- ✅ **No extra configuration** - works with existing zones
- ✅ **No customer_id required** - derived from API token

**See:** [Async Mode Guide](docs/async_mode_guide.md) for detailed usage

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Fixed SyncBrightDataClient**: Removed unused `customer_id` parameter that was incorrectly being passed to `BrightDataClient`
- **Fixed Web Unlocker async timeout**: Changed default `poll_timeout` from 30s to 180s (Web Unlocker async takes ~145 seconds)

### 🚨 Breaking Changes

#### Removed GenericScraper
```python
# OLD (v2.0.0)
result = await client.scrape.generic.url("https://example.com")

# NEW (v2.1.0) - Use scrape_url() directly
result = await client.scrape_url("https://example.com")
```

#### Async Method Naming Convention
The `_async` suffix has been removed. Now `method()` is async by default, and `method_sync()` is the synchronous version.

```python
# OLD (v2.0.0)
result = await scraper.products_async(url)
await job.wait_async()
data = await job.fetch_async()

# NEW (v2.1.0)
result = await scraper.products(url)
await job.wait()
data = await job.fetch()
```

#### CLI Command Change
```bash
# OLD
brightdata scrape generic --url https://example.com

# NEW
brightdata scrape url --url https://example.com
```

### ✨ New Features

#### Complete SyncBrightDataClient
Added comprehensive `sync_client.py` with full coverage for all scrapers:

```python
from brightdata import SyncBrightDataClient

with SyncBrightDataClient() as client:
    # All methods work synchronously
    result = client.scrape.amazon.products(url)
    result = client.scrape.linkedin.profiles(url)
    result = client.search.google("query")
```

**Supported sync wrappers:**
- `SyncAmazonScraper` - products, reviews, sellers (+ trigger/status/fetch)
- `SyncLinkedInScraper` - profiles, jobs, companies, posts
- `SyncInstagramScraper` - profiles, posts, comments, reels
- `SyncFacebookScraper` - posts_by_profile, posts_by_group, comments, reels
- `SyncChatGPTScraper` - prompt, prompts
- `SyncSearchService` - google, bing, yandex
- `SyncCrawlerService` - crawl, scrape

#### Context Manager Enforcement
Client methods now require proper context manager initialization:

```python
# Correct usage
async with BrightDataClient() as client:
    result = await client.scrape_url(url)

# Will raise RuntimeError
client = BrightDataClient()
result = await client.scrape_url(url)  # Error: not initialized
```

### 🔄 Migration Guide

#### Method Renames
| Old (v2.0.0) | New (v2.1.0) |
|--------------|--------------|

- **New**: Hierarchical service-based API (`client.scrape.amazon.products()`, `client.search.google()`)

#### Method Naming Convention
```python
# OLD
client.scrape_linkedin.profiles(url)
client.search_linkedin.jobs()

# NEW
client.scrape.linkedin.profiles(url)
client.search.linkedin.jobs()
```

#### Return Types

with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10) as executor:
    results = executor.map(self.scrape, urls)
```

**New**: Native async/await throughout with sync wrappers
```python
# New approach - native async (method() is async by default)
async def products(self, url):
    async with self.engine:
        return await self._execute_workflow(...)

# Sync client uses persistent event loop
with SyncBrightDataClient() as client:
    result = client.scrape.amazon.products(url)
```

#### 2. Service-Based Architecture
**Old**: Monolithic `bdclient` class with all methods
**New**: Layered architecture with specialized services
```
BrightDataClient
├── scrape (ScrapeService)
│   ├── amazon (AmazonScraper)
│   ├── linkedin (LinkedInScraper)
│   └── instagram (InstagramScraper)
├── search (SearchService)

```

#### 3. Workflow Pattern Implementation
**Old**: Direct HTTP requests with immediate responses
**New**: Trigger/Poll/Fetch workflow for long-running operations
```python
# New workflow pattern
snapshot_id = await trigger(payload)     # Start job
status = await poll_until_ready(snapshot_id)  # Check progress
data = await fetch_results(snapshot_id)  # Get results
```

```

#### 3. Type-Safe Payloads (Dataclasses)
```python
# New - structured payloads with validation
from brightdata import AmazonProductPayload
payload = AmazonProductPayload(
    url="https://amazon.com/dp/B123",
    reviews_count=100
)

# Old - untyped dictionaries
payload = {"url": "...", "reviews_count": 100}
```

```

#### 5. Registry Pattern for Scrapers
```python
# New - self-registering scrapers
@register("amazon")
class AmazonScraper(BaseWebScraper):
    DATASET_ID = "gd_l7q7dkf244hwxbl93"
```

#### 6. Advanced Telemetry

### 🎯 Summary

Version 2.0.0 represents a **complete rewrite** of the Bright Data Python SDK, not an incremental update. The new architecture prioritizes:

1. **Modern Python patterns**: Async-first with proper resource management
2. **Developer experience**: Hierarchical APIs, type safety, CLI tools
3. **Production reliability**: Comprehensive error handling, telemetry
4. **Platform coverage**: All major platforms with specialized scrapers
5. **Flexibility**: Three levels of control (simple, workflow, manual)

This is a **breaking release** requiring code changes. The migration effort is justified by:
- 10x improvement in concurrent operation handling
- 50+ new platform-specific methods
- Proper async support for modern applications
- Comprehensive timing and cost tracking
- Future-proof architecture for new platforms
